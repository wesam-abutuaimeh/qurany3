## Simple website clone from existing Extinction called QuranTab, Just for fun and to show some of my skills in integration with APIs and Vanilla JS <3 ðŸ™ƒ

Through my use of advanced skills in working with

- third-party APIs,
- JSON,
- modern HTML5 updated tags such as template tag and more ,
- CSS3 features,
- and JavaScript ES [6+7].
- use npm and CDN

I have created a feature-rich and visually appealing website that demonstrates my expertise in modern web development and my ability to integrate external APIs and use modern web standards is a testament to my skill as a developer .
